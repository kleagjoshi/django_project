Project Overview

Nowadays, where technology is all around us, every company and business are trying to digitalise their activities by providing real time management and service. Building a platform where management and service can be incorporated in a single system might be the key to efficiency and productivity, providing a user-friendly environment for all types of users. However, developing and implementing these systems in the market often faces a lot of challenges.
Considering the rapid development of digital tools, we expect to find every service online, but here in Albania, many areas of life and economy are stuck in the traditional ways. This might come as a result of lacking user-friendly and easy to use softwares which businesses can incorporate in their daily activity.
We are proposing a solution for one of the most common types of businesses in our country, Learning Centres (aka. Course centers/Academies). Every learning center in Albania keeps the studentâ€™s information in hardcopy files or excel sheets. They are usually stored physically, which might not be very convenient, causing problems in data collection and storage. Course management, timetables, payments and materials, which usually are a responsibility of the receptionist or the assigned manager, might also represent issues in the overall management of these centers.
